# Mist-Webhook-Receiver

This project was created to give you the steps to setup an Ubuntu server and install the ELK stack on it.
Logstash is will be configured as a HTTP Receiver to accept the webhooks from Mist, they will be 
processed into Elasticsearch and Kibana allows users to search the webhooks and build useful dashboards
with the data.

Dashboard JSON files can be committed as folks build useful things in their environment. The hope is that this
will be a collaborative project that will be useful to anyone using Juniper Mist APs.
